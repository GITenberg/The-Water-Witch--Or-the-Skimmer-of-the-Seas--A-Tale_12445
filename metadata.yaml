description: Pivoting on the attempts by Dutch merchants and American sailors to evade
  the taxes of the corrupt British government, The Water-Witch is almost prophetic
  as Cooper depicts the politics that led to the Revolution. The vivacious Alida de
  Barberie and her colorful crew make this one of Cooper's most beguiling tales.
